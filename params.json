A sticky view is a view that can be displayed on every defined perspective and that remains displayed when switching to another perspective.\r\nThis can be used for example for implementing a help window (next coming project).\r\n\r\n## How to use it?\r\n\r\nIn order to defined your own sticky view, you just need to extend the extension point `stickyviewExtensionPoint` giving the following attributes:\r\n* `partId`: The id that will be given to the created part. This id will also be used as a basis for the open/close command and handler.\r\n* `containerData`: Usual container data. Used in particular for defining the opening size\r\n* `position`: Defines the opening position. Should be one of left, right, top or bottom;\r\n* `partClass`: Defines the class for the part implementation. This should be a usual part implementation for E4 (with a @PostConstruct)\r\n* `label`: Defines the label of the part (used for the tab label).\r\n* `visibleAtStartup`: Defines whether the sticky view should be displayed at startup or not. Should be true or false.\r\n* `shortcut`: The shortcut sequence for opening and closing the sticky view (e.g.: M1+M2+H)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
